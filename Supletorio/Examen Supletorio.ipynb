April 23, 1993\\n(Phone:  202/358-1780)\\n\\nKyle Herring\\nJohnson Space Center, Houston\\n(Phone:  713/483-5111)\\n\\nRELEASE:  93-76\\n\\nHUBBLE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSION SCHEDULED FOR ELEVEN DAYS\\n\\n\\tThe December flight of Endeavour on Space Shuttle mission STS-61 to\\nservice the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has been scheduled as an 11 day\\nmission designed to accommodate a record five spacewalks with the capability\\nfor an additional two, if needed.\\n\\n\\tThe decision to schedule five extravehicular activities, or EVAs, was\\nreached following extensive evaluations of underwater training, maneuver times\\nrequired using the Shuttle\\'s robot arm based on software simulations and actual\\nEVA tasks on previous missions.\\n\\n\\t\"Basically what we\\'ve done by going to five EVAs rather than three is\\nto repackage our margin so that we have the capability to respond to the\\ndynamics, or unknowns, of spacewalks,\" Mission Director Randy Brinkley said.\\n\"It improves the probabilities for mission success while providing added\\nflexibility and adaptability for reacting to real-time situations.\"\\n\\n\\tIn laying out the specific tasks to be completed on each of the\\nspacewalks, officials have determined that changing out the gyros, solar arrays\\nand the Wide Field/Planetary Camera (WF/PC) and installing the Corrective\\nOptics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) are priority objectives\\nduring the mission.\\n\\n\\t\"When we looked at accomplishing all of the tasks, highest through\\nlowest priority, and recognizing that the major tasks -- gyros, solar arrays,\\nWF/PC and COSTAR -- would consume most of the time set aside for each\\nspacewalk, five EVAs were deemed appropriate,\" said Milt Heflin, Lead Flight\\nDirector for the mission.\\n\\n\\tWhile the five spacewalks will be unprecedented, the use of two\\nalternating spacewalk teams will alleviate placing more stress on the crew than\\nprevious missions requiring two, three or four EVAs.\\n\\n\\t\"We have paid close attention to lessons learned during previous\\nspacewalks and factored these into our timeline estimates for five EVAs,\"\\nHeflin said.  \"In planning for all Space Shuttle missions, it is necessary to\\nformulate a work schedule that represents as realistic a timeline as possible\\nto accomplish the mission objectives.\"\\n\\n\\tPlanning currently calls for at least five water tank training sessions\\nthat include support from the Mission Control Center, called joint integrated\\nsimulations, lasting between 10 and 36 hours.  In addition, many stand alone\\nunderwater training \"runs\" will practice individual tasks in each spacewalk.\\n\\n\\tVarious refinements to the specific tasks on each spacewalk will be\\nmade based on actual training experience during the months prior to the\\nmission.

D1).  I thought I\\'d post it to\\nstir up some flame wars - I mean reasoned debate.  Let me preface it by\\nsaying that I largely agree that the \"Space Age\" in the romantic sense\\nof several decades ago is over, and that projects like the space station\\nmiss the point at this time.  Reading, for example, \"What\\'s New\" -\\nthe weekly physics update we get here on the net - it\\'s clear that the\\nromance of the day lies in the ever more fine-grained manipulation of\\nmatter: by which I include biotechnology, condensed matter physics (with\\nits spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere), and the amazing things\\npeople are doing with individual atoms these days.  To a large extent, I\\nthink, the romance some people still have with space is a matter of\\nnostalgia.  I feel sure that someday we - or more precisely, our \"mind\\nchildren\" - will spread across space (unless we wipe ourselves out); but\\nI think that *manned* space exploration is not what is exciting about\\nwhat we can do *now*.   \\n\\nAnyway, let me quote some of this article, but not all...\\n\\n\\nSPACE AGE GLORY FADES FROM VIEW\\n\\nMicheal Schrage (writer, consultant, and research associate at MIT)\\n\\nAt 35, America\\'s Space Age won\\'t have to suffer through the angst of a\\nmidlife crisis.\\n\\nThe reason is that the Space Age is already dead.  The technologies no\\nlonger define our times, and the public has grown weary of the multibillion\\n-dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economic\\nrewards.  \\n\\nSpace exploration has mutated from a central focuse of America\\'s science\\nand technology debate into a peripheral issue.  Speace is not a\\nmeaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate, our\\ntechnology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversion\\npolicy.  \\n\\nTo be sure, America should continue to invest in satellite technologies\\nfor telecommunications and remote sensing - cheap deep-space probes\\nwould be nice too - but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver of\\nscientific and industrial innovation is now dead.\\n\\n.....\\n\\nBefore the change in administrations, it would have been foolish to\\nwrite an obituary for the Space Age.  The Bush White House aggressively\\nsupported the space program and proposed spending well over $30 billion\\nto build space station Freedom alone.\\n\\nEven as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains,\\nOffice of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman was an outspoken\\npublic champion of big-ticket space expenditures.  The reality that much\\nof the civilian space program - from the shuttle to the Hubble telescope\\nto the space station - was poorly conceived and unimpressively\\nimplemented did not seem to matter much.\\n\\nPolitical inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism - not a coherent\\nvision or cost-effective sensibilities - determined multibillion-dollar\\nspace budgets.\\n\\nIndeed, with few notable exceptions, such as Voyager, the post-Apollo\\nera is the story of the gold-plated porkification of space exploration\\nwith programs and promises that delivered less for more and more.  \\n\\n......\\n\\nWhile the Clinton Administration has kept on the highly regarded Daniel\\nGoldin as administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space\\nAdministration, it seems clear that space exploration is not being\\npositioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of America\\'s\\ntechnological prowess.  The space station budget has - rightly - been\\nslashed.  Space is virtually ignored when the Administration champions\\nits competitiveness agenda.\\n\\n......', 0.3804707451596266), ('Archive-name: space/intro\\nLast-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:10 $\\n\\n    FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ON SCI.SPACE/SCI.ASTRO\\n\\n    INTRODUCTION\\n\\n    This series of linked messages is periodically posted to the Usenet\\ngroups sci.space and sci.astro in an attempt to provide good answers to\\nfrequently asked questions and other reference material which is worth\\npreserving. If you have corrections or answers to other frequently asked\\nquestions that you would like included in this posting, send email to\\nleech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech).\\n\\n    If you don\\'t want to see the FAQ, add \\'Frequently Asked Questions\\' to\\nyour KILL file for this group (if you\\'re not reading this with a newsreader\\nthat can kill articles by subject, you\\'re out of luck).\\n\\n    The FAQ volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed down\\nby rewriting and condensing over time. The FAQ postings are available in\\nthe Ames SPACE archive in FAQ/faq<#>.\\n\\n    Good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here. The\\npoint of this is to circulate existing information, and avoid rehashing old\\nanswers. Better to build on top than start again.

References are provided\\nbecause they give more complete information than any short generalization.\\n\\n    Questions fall into three basic types:\\n\\n    1) Where do I find some information about space?\\n\\n    Try your local public library first. The net is not a good place to ask\\n    for general information. Ask INDIVIDUALS (by email) if you must. There\\n    are other sources, use them, too. The net is a place for open ended\\n    discussion.\\n\\n    2) I have an idea which would improve space flight?\\n\\n    Hope you aren\\'t surprised, but 9,999 out of 10,000 have usually been\\n    thought of before. Again, contact a direct individual source for\\n    evaluation. NASA fields thousands of these each day.\\n\\n    3) Miscellanous queries.\\n\\n    These are addressed on a case-by-case basis in the following series of\\n    FAQ postings.\\n\\n\\n    SUGGESTIONS FOR BETTER NETIQUETTE\\n\\n    Read news.announce.newusers if you\\'re on Usenet.\\n    Minimize cross references, [Do you REALLY NEED to?]\\n    Edit \"Subject:\" lines, especially if you\\'re taking a tangent.\\n    Send mail instead, avoid posting follow ups.

(Check all\\n\\treferences.)\\n    Cut down attributed articles (leave only the points you\\'re\\n\\tresponding to; remove signatures and headers).
